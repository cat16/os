# uhhhhhh

so I'm learning from [this](https://os.phil-opp.com/)
I'm probably either going to keep enjoying this and actually make it usable or get annoyed but learn enough to work on redox...

or lose motivation :sunglasses:

either way I at least want to learn OS / cpu arch fundamentals through this
